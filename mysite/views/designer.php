      <span>An invitation that I created for an exibition where artists such as David Kibuuka &
Barbara Mc Givern presented their paintings. I worked closely with both artists in the creation 
of their booklets that displayed their artistic Master pieces. All created by Docu tech 6060 Booklet
maker. This invitation was made available at art stores across the Mississauga and Oakville area, 
therefore I feel confident that I have not breached any contractual obligations that I may have 
signed for at Image Factory. This invitation was created within an “outside the box” profile. </span>
