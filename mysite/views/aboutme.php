		 <h2>Hola!</h2>
		 <p>
			I guess what follows is my introduction.
			I am Kelly Purdie the founder of {CK:ME}
					->( s-e-e-k  me).
			I have lived in a world full of creativity with awkward andcomplicated moments which many would perceive as chaos; I saw the perfect canvas for the creation of art! 
			The medium is not important, ultimately the outcome is what moves people. 
			P-e-o-p-l-e, the word seems so simple but its depth is profound. We all have utilized or created a form of communication to reach each other and if you think about it, most of us live our life day-in, day-out in a never ending  journey, trying to improve the gap between connection and communication. I believe this is why social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have emerged from the ground up with such success.
			In my life journey I found myself trapped in many cases wondering which part of this world made more sense to me, where was I meant to grow? Do I choose Technology or Art?
			The truth is like religion and science, some believe that one has no relation to the other.  I however, belong to the clan that believes we can all co-exist, so why do we have to choose?
			I have taken many art courses and was pleased to have been introduced to the graphical realm.
			I love and I am move by the different creations of graphics and mixed sequence of colours but quickly found myself in a saturated market. After a rewarding job full of learning curves, challenges and obstacles, I learned that I was really good at problem solving.  Interacting and working together as a team in all levels of this company was also something I was good at. Than another curving ball happened, the company I was working for was closing its doors.
			I was shocked and ready to deliver my second baby girl, not the type of situation you want to be in at all.
			However, that is how I reached this point. After a year of maternity leave, I tried to find myself again but this time with a collection of attributes and the knowledge of knowing what moves me and the conviction that I could still create art in whatever medium was presented. Who knew that technology could hold a plethora of artistic opportunities and problem solving?
			I hope you enjoy the site and the point of view it was based on.
